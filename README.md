## Team Awesome

This project is the front end to the future Team Awesome application which will allow enterprises to track time registration of their employees.

You can add new Time Entries and Team Members with some limitations. You can filter these entries and members by some primary variables of these objects.

## Installation

To get a demo of this front end web app, check out this repo and use

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```
npm run test		// will run Jest with a Watcher.
npm run cypress		// will fire up Cypress with some End to End test options.
```
